# ‚úÖ Semantic Index Cleaned & Improved! 

## What Was Fixed

I've successfully removed the 4 meta/index/intro posts that were skewing the analysis:

‚ùå **Excluded from Analysis:**
- "Cataloging My Blogposts: An Organized Breakdown by Category"
- "Introduction to the Talmud" 
- "Guide to Online Resources for Scholarly Jewish Study and Research - 2023"
- "Beyond the Mystique: Correcting Common Misconceptions About the Talmud, and Pathways to Accessibility"

## üìä Improved Results

### **Before vs After:**
- **Total Posts:** 539 ‚Üí **535** (4 meta posts removed)
- **Analysis Quality:** Much more authentic thematic representation
- **Featured Posts:** Now showing genuine content rather than meta-references

### **Example Improvements in Top Themes:**

#### **Wisdom Tales** (522 posts)
**Before:** Meta posts dominated featured list  
**After:** Genuine wisdom content like:
